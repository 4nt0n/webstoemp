## Collaborate, Build, Iterate

Using a static site generator was natural for the team: [Central Design](http://central.team/) uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to create and maintain style guides for clients. They are also huge fans of Markdown and could thus easily integrate Jekyll in their workflow.

Using such a tool allowed us to work together using a simple Git workflow and to have everything, including the content, in version control. The team at Central could concentrate on design, content and front end while I was working on the data model, logic and Jekyll build. Using a static site generator with a team that is used to collaborate and iterate quickly meant that we had a working website we could deploy to any server in a matter of days.

## Close collaboration with UX and Design

One of the nice aspect of that project is that it allowed me to collaborate with seasoned UX and visual designers. Keeping a copywriter in the loop was also easy once we started pushing the website on a staging server. Jekyll essentially got out of the way to become the tool we used to collaborate.

I already use Jekyll a lot to create HTML/CSS/JS prototypes and publish them on Github pages for my clients to see. This project has prompted me to look into using Jekyll or file based CMS like [Statamic](https://statamic.com/) for the final product too.
