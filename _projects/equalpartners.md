## A lean and iterative project

The [EQUAL](http://www.equal-partners.eu) project is an interesting one: a group of established and young lawyers stepped out of their comfort zone to create a new company together. They set out to reimagine what a Law Firm could be and found innovative ways to collaborate between themselves and with their clients.

In just 10 days, a team put together by [Major Tom](http://major-tom-company.eu/) worked together to create a brand new logo, a video teaser, a graphical identity and a one page website in three languages. Several photo shootings were conducted as well.

From a web point of view, the priority was to create an online presence for EQUAL. After working on the content, I developed a graphical style guide to establish a design language. A responsive one page website was developed in just 5 days using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I am currently working on a bigger Craft-powered website for phase two.

## True collaborative work

When developing a project in a very short amount of time, you need:

- a good team of professionals
- top notch project management
- constant communication and collaboration with the client

Thanks to Major Tom's lead, the project ran very smoothly and the client was kept in the loop at every stage of the project.

I am really looking forward to phase two for the EQUAL website. Be it laywers or anyone else, working with a group of people believing in their dreams and setting out to build something new is always interesting.
