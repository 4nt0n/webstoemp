				<li><strong>Timescale:</strong> by when do you need the website to be online? I am usually booked for long term projects a couple of months in advance and I also have teaching duties. I will generally not be able to start "today".</li>
				<li><strong>Budget:</strong> what budget have you set aside for your project? It does not mean I will necessarily use it all, but it helps me determine how much time I can allocate to it. Tailor-made websites usually start from around 5000&nbsp;EUR and frequently go above that price. Workshops and trainings are billed at a daily rate of 600&nbsp;EUR.</li>
				<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> a description of the website you want to build in terms of functionalities. Bonus points if you explain how this project will help your business.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If the above works for you, send me a description of your project requirements, along with your contact details or send me an email to schedule a call.</p>
